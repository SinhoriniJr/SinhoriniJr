Hi There!👋
 
My name is Milton Junior. I'm 27 years old, and in 2023 I had my first contact with the world of programming. I started with HTML and CSS, and today my main focus is on developing web applications using the Spring Framework (Java) and React.
I'm passionate about learning and constantly seeking to expand my knowledge.
<br>I have basic knowledge of Spring.<br/>
 


- 👨‍💻 I work as an IT intern at Colégio Salvatoriano Nossa Senhora de Fátima, where I help develop solutions to improve educational and administrative workflows.

- 💡 My repositories reflect my learning journey and practical projects — from front-end interfaces to backend APIs and DevOps experiments.

- 📚 Constantly learning and looking for new challenges to grow as a developer.
